_Ladies and Gentlemen, it's Winamp, for Android!_

Introducing Xenamp - A Winamp 2.x clone for Android, written from scratch in Java. It is full open source and features the skinning engine abstracted to be reused in a new project easily. 

It is still in Alpha, and a long way to go for full release, but some features already work, including (yay!) access to (hopefully) pixel perfect rendering of  over 65,000 skins from the Winamp Skin Museum. 

Currently in Alpha, testing only!
